# Trends at a Glance

This repository showcases how I leverage **Microsoft Dynamics** and third-party metric data to track hold times for chats vs. phone calls. By utilizing **Power Automate**, I automate the collection of this data from a SharePoint folder and integrate it into **Power BI** to provide actionable insights on a monthly and daily basis.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Microsoft Dynamics**: To collect chat and phone call data.
- **Third-party Metric Exports**: To compare chat vs. phone hold times.
- **Power Automate**: Automating the export of data whenever a new file is uploaded to SharePoint.
- **Power BI**: Visualizing trends and producing business insights.
- **SharePoint**: Storing the incoming data files.
- **Internal Dashboard Creation**: The use of internal tools to create live dashboards via NICE CX.

## Key Features:
- **Monthly and Daily Trends**: View chat vs. phone hold times over time to spot trends and identify patterns.
- **Automated Data Export**: Power Automate workflow to automatically update the dataset when new files are uploaded.
- **Power BI Reports**: Trend visualization to help with informed decision-making, executive reporting, and employee feedback.

Explore the different sections of this repository to understand how each part of the process is automated and visualized.

# Power Automate Flow: Data Export from SharePoint

This Power Automate flow is triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to the specified SharePoint folder. The flow then automatically exports this data into a format readable by Power BI.

## Steps:
Hereâ€™s the full flow process:

1. **Trigger**: New file uploaded to SharePoint.
2. **Action**: Retrieve the file content.
3. *Optional*: Parse data from the file (if necessary).
4. **Action**: Refresh the Power BI dataset to reflect the new data.
5. *Optional**: Notify stakeholders of the update.

See this accompanying Document for a visual representation of the flow:

## Microsoft Dynamics and Internal NICE CX Dashboards:
***Please Note***:

I cannot share any of the raw data files or NICE CX dashboards to showcase my dashboard creation and relative analystics in regards to daily, weekly, monthly trends due to the restriction of my current NDA at my current employer. However - I would be more than willing to talk about these in depth via phone call or meeting!
